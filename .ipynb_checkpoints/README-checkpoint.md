# Jupyter

This notebook is stored in a directory on my computer that is also a git repositry. Github works with Jupyter notebooks, but only renders the notebooks as a static page, similar to NBViewer (which was also created by the Jupyter Project).

There is however, another cool project called binder, that can create a container to run the notebook interactivey. It can be found at https://mybinder.org/
